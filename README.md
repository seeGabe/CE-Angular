# CrestronUsers

This project was intended to showcase my skills based upon a set of requirements that would test my abilities with Angular, PrimeNG, Chart.JS, and interfacing with a public Rest API(api.github.com).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
